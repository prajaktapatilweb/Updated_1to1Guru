                Through 1to1Guru&apos;s personal coaching I learnt a lot.
                Especially, I was weak in English but I got an excellent
                teacher who&apos;s explanation and clearing of concepts are
                so much satisfying . So my english has been improved and also
                I have no fear of the subject now. Moreover, I have joined
                Science class too. The topic are taught in ppt, video
                presentation and animation. Every doubt is cleared and
                explained well.

                I like to learn one to one. Because the teacher taught me the
                subject at my speed. Regular followup and practice test helps
                me a lot. The Time Management was also given by the teacher.
